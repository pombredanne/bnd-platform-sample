bnd-platform-sample
===================

Sample project using [bnd-platform](https://github.com/stempler/bnd-platform) to build a set of OSGi bundles.

Check out **build.gradle** and the script files in **modules/** to see what you can do with *bnd-platform* and run the build with `./gradlew` or `gradlew.bat` to create OSGi bundles and an Eclipse Update Site from the dependencies configured in the example. The created bundles will reside in **build/plugins**, the p2 repository in **build/updatesite**.
